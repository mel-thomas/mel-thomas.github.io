                <h2 class="h2 main_h2">Background</h2>
                <p class="main_p">
                    Screenwriting is an insular, highly competitive, and often idiosyncratic field. Its software is also stuck in the past. These phenomena are, of course, related. Studio heads have exacting expectations when it comes to how screenplays should look and are unwilling to compromise, leaving their writers to fill in the gaps.
                </p>
                <p class="main_p">
                    Screenwriters have a choice. They can use the antiquated, non-collaborative software that gives their scripts that iconic screenplay look, or they can use modern, cloud-based text editors that don’t fit their specific formatting needs. Either way, they have extra work to do on top of an already high-stress job. That’s where Scripto’s collaborative editor comes in.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="main_text">
                <h2 class="h2 main_h2">Problem</h2>
                <p class="main_p">The editor is Scripto’s flagship feature. It’s made up of dozens of features, really—collaborative editing, rich text formatting, access level management—each with their own design challenges. Most unique to Scripto, though, and key to its users’ success is specific block types that combine to produce scripts that look identical to what industry pros produce in Final Draft, but with all the collaborative ease of Google Docs.</p>
                <p class="main_p">Plenty of text editors accommodate different block types (think tiered headings and numbered lists), but most assume you'll be writing in plain text by default. Screenwriters have different needs. There’s no default type of text in a screenplay or studio TV script. Every word in a script belongs to a hyper-specific element type—think scene headings, transitions, and character names. Users need to be able to identify these block types on sight and shift nimbly between them.</p>

            <div class="main_text">
                <h2 class="h2 main_h2">Solution</h2>
                <p class="main_p">Making the contents of the editor look like a script was the easy part—it was just a matter of matching fonts and margins to industry standards. The real design challenge was communicating to the user what type of block they’re editing, and making it dead simple to change that block type if it’s wrong. We wanted to make it so simple that writers are never afraid of accidentally writing in the wrong type. They’ll know it’s a snap to change and there are several ways to do it. Knowing that was our goal, I invested a lot of creative energy into getting the icons and interactions right.</p>
                <p class="main_p">Icons aren’t just about aesthetics. They’re a hugely valuable communication tool. I designed  custom icons to illustrate the block types as closely as possible, as opposed to choosing icons from an existing library. Using my early concepts, I conducted a survey of early users and Scripto friendlies and used the results to inform our final decision.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="main_text">
                <p class="main_p">As for the interactions, we decided there’d be absolutely no nesting or mixing-and-matching. Block types are discrete entities, and each block can only have one type at a time. This prevents ugly surprises down the road and makes switching block types is completely painless and non-destructive.</p>
                <p class="main_p">We also intentionally designed multiple methods to change your block type, including tabbing, choosing from a UI menu, and using dedicated keyboard shortcuts. The core idea we want users to internalize is: Scripto is flexible, and block types can be changed. Establishing this trust encourages folks to get in and get writing without worrying about being perfect on the first try. They know they can always change things up later. </p>

                    <p class="main_p">Signing up for Scripto is deceptively complex. You need to create your account, but there’s also the matter of creating your workspace, and what if you actually want to join an existing workspace? There’s a lot of steps, a lot that could go wrong, and a lot of opportunities to get lost.</p>

                <div class="main_text">
                    <h2 class="h2 main_h2">Problem</h2>
                    <p class="main_p">Users were getting lost and confused along the sign up process, particularly at the juncture between account creation and workspace creation. We were seeing initiated sign-ups be abandoned and were getting help desk tickets from users lost in the process.</p>
                    <p class="main_p">As Scripto continued to grow, we were also dealing with increased security concerns from our bigger clients. Not only did we need to flatten and dymystify the sign up flow, but we also needed to add email verification and password strength enforcement to it.</p>
                    <p class="main_p">We needed to rethink how users get started in the app. How could we present all the required steps in a way that feels undaunting and that clearly communicated to users where they are in the process? How can we best prime them for the experience of using Scripto and set them up for success?</p>
                    <h2 class="h2 main_h2">Solution</h2>
                    <p class="main_p">We decided to break the flow into two chunks. The first for creating your account (required for everyone using Scripto) and second for creating your workspace (required for people who aren’t joining an existing show). Both flows can be completed independently of each other, and the latter flow can be resumed at any step.</p>
                    <p class="main_p">For the account creation flow, which can only be restarted—not resumed—if interrupted, I designed a stepper so users could always see where they are in the process, get a sense of how long it’ll take, and navigate back and between steps if they make a mistake.</p>

                    <p class="main_p">Collaboratively editing a shared script necessitates conversations about said script, which is why comments were among the first features we designed and built way back in 2017. Screenwriters use comments to collaborate with each other and discuss alternative ideas, but also to communicate with the production team about props, graphics, and teleprompter programming.</p>
                    <h2 class="h2 main_h2">Problem</h2>
                    <p class="main_p">Shows need comments to be reliable, resolveable, sortable chronologically and in script order, and most importantly: they can never interfere with the script. The script is sacrosanct. Every word, every character is painstakingly selected.</p>
                    <p class="main_p">The problem was that we iterated and improved on other, surrounding features until our original comments implementation became too brittle to rely on. Most crucially, from the users’ perspective, comments had begun to overlap the script itself. So the fine-grained script edits that users were using the comments to try to communicate about were quite literally being obscured by the comments themselves.</p>
                    <p class="main_p">The question became: how can we build better comments that are easily accessible when they’re needed and easily ignored when they’re not?</p>

                <p class="main_p">The biggest decision was the overall UX. We already knew what comments needed to do in terms of functionality. They key design challenge was a holistic one. We needed to find a better, less intrusive way for comments to coexist with the script. I mapped out three possible approaches and presented them to the team. In the end, we decided on a dedicated side panel that can be open and closed.</p>
                <p>The dedicated side panel can be accessed multiple ways, depending out how users are interacting with comments at the time. For example, comments are viewable in chronological order from a feed in the toolbar. Clicking them opens the comment panel, scrolls to the selected comment and triggers its active UI state. </p>

                    <p class="main_p">Search was a table stakes feature we designed and implemented very early in Scripto’s development and then set off to the side, because at first, nobody really used it. Then, as more shows signed up for Scripto and existing shows used Scripto for longer, they began to need to search through larger and larger volumes of their old work, and the experience of navigating to our dedicated search page and sifting through its unsophisticated and often irrelevant results was often frustrating for them.</p>
                    <p class="main_p">The first point of frustration was that, on a busy day, writers don’t want to navigate away from their current script if they don’t have to. More likely than not, they’re searching to find an old line or scrapped joke to paste into their current document. They don’t want to have to actually click into dozens of scripts, losing sight of their current one. The current script is something writers are keeping tabs on at all times—almost like a social feed, but more stressful. Their cowriters are working in there, and they don’t want to lose track of the ongoing changes that are happening at breakneck speeds. So the core UX question we needed to answer was: how can we let users search without having to navigate away from their current script?</p>

                    <p class="main_p">After exploring several approaches, we decided on my concept for adding a new "search" view to our existing sidebar component, making it navigable from anywhere in the app, including the editor. Users can now conduct searches and sort through multiple pages of results without needing to navigate away from their current script.</p>
                    <p class="main_p">I also designed a filtering system that allows users to make more refined searches with minimal additional effort. In researching this problem, I learned from our users that the date the script was last edited is arguably the most important piece of metadata about any given script. When searching, our users usually looking for scripts edited within the last few days or within a specific date range (e.g. “I know we did that joke in episode three of season two.” So by adding a “date” filter (in addition to a few other filters we learned were important, such as folder location), search in Scripto went from trawling to spearfishing.</p>

I have a social media platform where I talk about books and media analysis, and I’ve made a lot of friends along the way who do the same thing. The issue is, I hate navigating their link-in-bio sites. More often than not, they’re long, unorganized lists with hugely variable calls to action that are exhausting to peruse if you’re looking for anything in particular or even if you’re just trying to get a sense of who a creator is as a person. After getting frustrated with these sites and also needing to build my own, it occurred to me that some modular building blocks and smart information architecture could go a long way towards making links-in-bio more communicative and useful.</p>

Then I designed the link so that it can both take on additional components and also live in different contexts. It can live on its own, as a direct call to action within a larger chunk of text, or as a feature with an associated image, and various combinations of all of the above, resulting in a modular system that allows for better information organization that’s much quicker to navigate than a standard list of links, not to mention more fun.</p>

                    <p class="main_p">In my free time, I make video essays about books, art, and internet culture. I needed a place to store links to my work, but I wanted to make something more interesting than the typical Squarespace-style site. I wanted a site that telegraphed my personality. I wanted a site that was <i>fun</i>, because at the end of the day, that’s what I believe the web should be.</p>
                    <p class="main_p">So I joined a vibrant crew of indie web enthusiasts over on <a href="https://neocities.org/">Neocities</a>. As a community we share a general design sensibility—one that takes inspiration from retro UI and remixes it to emphasize humanity, creativity, and fun.</p>
                    <p class="main_p">I think of this website as an ongoing gardening project. I’ve designed it to be modular (in its own deliberately idiosyncratic way), and I frequently tack on new sections and remove old ones that are no longer useful to me. It’s been a great way to stretch my muscles, and it’s also an interesting thought exercise. What would the web be like if it could be anything we wanted? What would the web be like if we built it ourselves?</p>
