                    <p class="main_p">I have a decade of experience building thoughtful, accessible, and scalable solutions with real humans in mind. I thrive as the link between product and development, creating user-centered solutions and shepherding them from wireframes to code.</p>
                    <p class="main_p">I'm creative and nimble and love to work across clearcut job descriptions. I value being a member of a teamâ€”the scrappier, the betterâ€”but I do my best thinking in my own space, which is why I love to work remote.</p>
                    <p class="main_p">For the past 7 years I've led product design at <a href="https://www.scripto.live/">Scripto</a>, but before that I worked at <a href="https://www.waystar.com/">ZirMed (now Waystar)</a> designing UI for a suite of products that helped doctors' offices get paid by insurance companies. Before that, I dabbled as a graphic design generalist, and before that, I studied studio art at the University of Louisville, where I graduated cum laude in 2013.</p>

                    <h2 class="h2 main_h2">At play</h2>
                    <p class="main_p">I live in Louisville, Kentucky with my husband and our dog.</p>
                    <p class="main_p">When I'm not working, I like to read. I have a TikTok account with 68k followers where I post bite-sized essays and book reviews. I also like to write. I'm working on two novels: one about a necromancer and a former classmate he brings back to life, and another about two people falling in love over a tech support email thread. Neither story is based on true events. ðŸ˜‰</p>
                    <p class="main_p">I also like to cook, garden, and drink craft beer with friends. Lately I've been making miniature sculptures out of polymer clay. I'm slowly perfecting my lasagna recipe. This year I took up bread-baking. I play pinball every Thursday.</p>
